Presentation
============

This is a tool to convert mails in a maildir format to mbox mailbox format.

Maildir format is used by many mail servers, and is simply a directory containing one file for each email. Mbox mailbox format is used by other mail servers and various tools (including Mailman, my original itch) and is a big file containing all emails one after the other, separated by a line like "From  sender@email.com  date".

It is basically the opposite of the "mb2md" tool. If this is what you're looking for, you're in the wrong place, mb2md is packaged on most distributions (Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install mb2md).

Currently, it's extremely simple and can be largely improved, but it did the job for me :) Patches welcome!


Rationale
=========

This script runs through all files in a maildir, and collects the From email address and Date from the corresponding headers. It then converts the date to the appropriate format for mbox, and outputs a "mbox header line" ("From  sender@email.com  date") followed by the email and a blank line.


Usage
=====

cd /path/to/your/source/maildir
maildir2mbox > /path/to/your/destination.mbox

Note: you must make sure that the path to the accompanying script "dateRfc3339ToMbox.pl" is correct in the maildir2mbox script.


Output
======

A primitive progess meter is displayed on stderr:

Starting up, found 1572 emails
Converting: 100% done
Finished.


Comments and feedback
